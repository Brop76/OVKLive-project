Note: this is so you guys can see what I have done so far but you guys can help if you want but this won't work until I make a realease for it when it's ready for beta. If you want to help look in the tools folder there should be a commandprompt and what you want to do is look in the decrypt commands and then use power isa big endian in ghidra but also in the project directory there is a file for ghidra which is what I have decompiled so far.
